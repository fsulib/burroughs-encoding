# Getting Started with the Burroughs Project

This document is a good place to start if you are a new encoder on the Burroughs Project. 

The Burroughs Project is a scholarly edition that allows for the comparison of multiple drafts of Burroughs' works. The project was started by Paul Ardoin as a part of his dissertation at the University of Antwerp. The edition is displayed in FSU's DigiNole, using the open-source software Islandora but the project was reviously hosted at Antwerp. 

The encoded documents that you see in the current Burroughs site are very different from the original documents, so it's important to make sure that you follow the *current* encoding practices, rather than those from previous iterations of the project. For more information on the transition and transformation of the encoding, see the [history of encoding](encoding-history.md) page.
