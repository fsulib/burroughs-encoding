## William Burroughs

### WSB1 

The "WSB1" hand is William Burroughs's hand in blue ink. Any time you encounter Burroughs intervening with a blue pen, you should utilize "#WSB1" in the `@hand` attribute.

### WSB2 

The "WSB1" hand is William Burroughs's hand in pencil. Any time you encounter Burroughs intervening with a pencil, you should utilize "#WSB1" in the `@hand` attribute.

### WSB3

The "WSB1" hand is William Burroughs's hand in black ink (specifically pen, *not* the ink from a typewriter). Any time you encounter Burroughs intervening with a black pen, you should utilize "#WSB1" in the `@hand` attribute.

## Typist 

### typist 

Anytime you encounter an addition, deletion, or substitution inserted by a typewriter, you should use "#typist". As we have no reliable way of discerning who made the intervention with the typewriter, we just use "#typist" on `@hand` for all typewritten interventions, regardless of who the suspected actor may be.

## Proofreaders

### proofreader 

The "proofreader" hand is used for an unidentified proofreader writing in black ink. This hand should only be used for scripts whose authors are *not* known and *not* listed in other portions of this list. So, if Burroughs is serving as a proofreader on his own document, you should use "#WSB1", and not "proofreader".

### proofreader1

The "proofreader1" hand is used for an unidentified proofreader writing in blue ink. This hand should only be used for scripts whose authors are *not* known and *not* listed in other portions of this list. So, if Burroughs is serving as a proofreader on his own document, you should use "#WSB3", and not "proofreader1".
